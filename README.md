# MNIST-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-for-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model creation, and performance evaluation using Conv1D and Conv2D layers.
